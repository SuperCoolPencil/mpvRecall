# üé¨ mpvRecall

**Resume your media exactly where you left off, seamlessly.**

`mpvRecall` is a simple yet powerful tool that leverages [mpv](https://mpv.io/) (a free, open-source, and cross-platform media player) and [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) to provide a user-friendly interface for resuming your video and audio playback. Whether you're watching a long movie, a series of episodes, or listening to an album, `mpvRecall` remembers your last position, allowing you to pick up right where you left off.

  If something goes wrong, check the **"Show raw mpv output"** section in the UI for debugging.

- **Zenity Dependency:**  
  If `zenity` is missing, file/folder selection will fail.
